                    <p>
                        With the development of location-acquisition technologies, there are a huge number of mobile
                        trajectories generated in a variety of domains. However, due to the constraints of device and
                        environment, many trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which increases the
                        uncertainty between two consecutive sampled points in the trajectories. Our task is to recover a
                        high-sampled trajectory based on the irregular low-sampled trajectory. There are two major
                        problems with traditional solutions. First, many of these methods rely on heuristic search
                        algorithms or simple probabilistic models, which cannot well capture complex sequential
                        dependencies or global correlations. Second, most of the previous studies adopt a common
                        preprocessing to map the trajectory into discrete units, which bring noises. To address the
                        above difficulties, we propose a novel Deep Hybrid Trajectory Recovery model. Our model extends
                        the classic sequence-to-sequence generation framework by implementing a subsequence-to-sequence
                        recovery model tailored for the current task, named subseq2seq. In order to effectively capture
                        spatiotemporal correlations, we adopt both spatial and temporal attentions for enhancing the
                        model performance. Furthermore, we integrate the subseq2seq with a Kalman filter component to
                        calibrate coarse-grained discrete units as fine-grained coordinates. Extensive results on
                        real-world datasets have shown the superiority of the proposed model.

                            recovery. To our knowledge, it is the first time that deep learning is integrated with KF
                            for the studied task. By using a hybrid of neural networks and KF, our model is endowed with
                            the benefits of both components, i.e., the capacities of modeling complex sequence data and
                            reducing predictive noise.

                            designed spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, which enhances the capacity of modeling
                            complex data correlations.

                        Personalized Route Recommendation (PRR) aims to generate user-specific route suggestions in
                        response to users’ route queries. Early studies cast the PRR task as a pathfinding problem on
                        graphs, and adopt adapted search algorithms by integrating heuristic strategies. Although these
                        methods are effective to some extent, they require setting the cost functions with heuristics.
                        In addition, it is difficult to utilize useful context information in the search procedure. To
                        address these issues, we propose using neural networks to automatically learn the cost functions
                        of a classic heuristic algorithm, namely A∗ algorithm, for the PRR task. Our model consists of
                        two components. First, we employ attention-based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to model the
                        cost from the source to the candidate location by incorporating useful context information.
                        Instead of learning a single cost value, the RNN component is able to learn a time-varying
                        vectorized representation for the moving state of a user. Second, we propose to use a value
                        network for estimating the cost from a candidate location to the destination. For capturing
                        structural characteristics, the value network is built on top of improved graph attention
                        networks by incorporating the moving state of a user and other context information. The two
                        components are integrated in a principled way for deriving a more accurate cost of a candidate
                        location. Extensive experiment results on three real-world datasets have shown the effectiveness
                        and robustness of the proposed model.

                    <p>
                        Recent years have witnessed the world-wide emergence of mega-metropolises with incredibly huge
                        populations. Understanding residents mobility patterns, or urban dynamics, thus becomes crucial
                        for building modern smart cities. In this paper, we propose a Neighbor-Regularized and
                        context-aware Non-negative Tensor Factorization model (NR-cNTF) to discover interpretable urban
                        dynamics from urban heterogeneous data. Different from many existing studies concerned with
                        prediction tasks via tensor completion, NR-cNTF focuses on gaining urban managerial insights
                        from spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal patterns. This is enabled by high-quality Tucker
                        factorizations regularized by both POI-based urban contexts and geographically neighboring
                        relations. NR-cNTF is also capable of unveiling long-term evolutions of urban dynamics via a
                        pipeline initialization approach. We apply NR-cNTF to a real-life data set containing rich taxi
                        GPS trajectories and POI records of Beijing. The results indicate: 1) NR-cNTF accurately
                        captures four kinds of city rhythms and seventeen spatial communities; 2) the rapid development
                        of Beijing, epitomized by the CBD area, indeed intensifies the job-housing imbalance; 3) the
                        southern areas with recent government investments have shown more healthy development tendency.
                        Finally, NR-cNTF is compared with some baselines on traffic prediction, which further justifies
                        the importance of urban contexts awareness and neighboring regulations.
