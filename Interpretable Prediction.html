                        The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a representation of the statistical
                        information discovered in binary classification problems and is a key concept in machine
                        learning and data science. This paper studies the statistical properties of ROC curves and its
                        implication on model selection. We analyze the implications of different models of incentive
                        heterogeneity and information asymmetry on the relation between human decisions and the ROC
                        curves. Our theoretical discussion is illustrated in the context of a large data set of

                        The deep network model, with the majority built on neural networks, has been proved to be a
                        powerful framework to represent complex data for high performance machine learning. In recent
                        years, more and more studies turn to nonneural network approaches to build diverse deep
                        structures, and the Deep Stacking Network (DSN) model is one of such approaches that uses
                        stacked easy-to-learn blocks to build a parameter-training-parallelizable deep network. In this
                        paper, we propose a novel SVM-based Deep Stacking Network (SVM-DSN), which uses the DSN
                        architecture to organize linear SVM classifiers for deep learning. A BP-like layer tuning scheme
                        is also proposed to ensure holistic and local optimizations of stacked SVMs simultaneously. Some
                        good math properties of SVM, such as the convex optimization, is introduced into the DSN
                        framework by our model. From a global view, SVM-DSN can iteratively extract data representations
                        layer by layer as a deep neural network but with parallelizability, and from a local view, each
                        stacked SVM can converge to its optimal solution and obtain the support vectors, which compared
                        with neural networks could lead to interesting improvements in anti-saturation and
                        interpretability. Experimental results on both image and text data sets demonstrate the
                        excellent performances of SVM-DSN compared with some competitive benchmark models.

                    <p>
                        Recent years have witnessed the unprecedented rising of time series from almost all kindes of
                        academic and industrial fields. Various types of deep neural network models have been introduced
                        to time series analysis, but the important frequency information is yet lack of effective
                        modeling. In light of this, in this paper we propose a wavelet-based neural network structure
                        called multilevel Wavelet Decomposition Network (mWDN) for building frequency-aware deep
                        learning models for time series analysis. mWDN preserves the advantage of multilevel discrete
                        wavelet decomposition in frequency learning while enables the fine-tuning of all parameters
                        under a deep neural network framework. Based on mWDN, we further propose two deep learning
                        models called Residual Classification Flow (RCF) and multi-frequecy Long Short-Term Memory
                        (mLSTM) for time series classification and forecasting, respectively. The two models take all or
                        partial mWDN decomposed sub-series in different frequencies as input, and resort to the back
                        propagation algorithm to learn all the parameters globally, which enables seamless embedding of
                        wavelet-based frequency analysis into deep learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 40 UCR
                        datasets and a real-world user volume dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of our time
                        series models based on mWDN. In particular, we propose an importance analysis method to mWDN
                        based models, which successfully identifies those time-series elements and mWDN layers that are
                        crucially important to time series analysis. This indeed indicates the interpretability
                        advantage of mWDN, and can be viewed as an indepth exploration to interpretable deep learning.
