                <p>
                    Recent years have witnessed rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), which drives many
                    applications such as urban computing, unmanned supermarket, smart house, smart logistics, etc. The
                    ubiquitous sensors and GPS devices installed on smartphones have been utilized as basic IoT
                    infrastructure to support these distinct applications, reshaping human behaviors as well as the
                    relationships and interaction patterns between human, things, and the environment. As all the things
                    are connected in a network enabled by IoT infrastructure, the status of each object can be monitored
                    in real-time, which opens up new perspectives for traditional management and poses great challenges
                    for operational and managerial decisions in real business scenarios.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indeed, the marriage of IoT and management suggests the possibility of an unshaped yet tangible new
                    scientific paradigm. On one hand, data is generating in million-second scale from IoT
                    infrastructure, which can help disclose behavioral patterns and corresponding working conditions and
                    thus calls for detailed data management and analytical solutions. On the other, management and
                    decisions can be operated in a more delicate way, because the granularity of control can be as tiny
                    as each monitored object, which calls for more research on new management problems aroused by the
                    proliferation of IoT, including decision process, scheduling strategies, quality control, value
                    creation, etc.
